# Slot Machine Game

## 1. Project Overview

A beginner-friendly yet logically strong Slot Machine Game designed to build a solid foundation in programming. This project is not just about making the program run, but about understanding how logic, randomness, and decision-making work together in real applications.

## 2. Purpose of the Project

This project was built to:

   * Strengthen core programming fundamentals
   * Practice real-world logic using a simple game
   * Learn how small programs are structured and executed
   * Gain confidence before moving to complex projects

## 3. Key Concepts Used

   * Random number generation
   * Conditional statements (if / else)
   * Loops for repeated execution
   * Functions / methods
   * User input handling

## 4. Features

* Random slot symbol generation
* Win and loss condition checks
* Multiple game rounds
* Simple and readable logic
* Beginner-friendly structure

## 5. Technologies Used

### Programming Language:
* Java 
### Tools 
* VS Code

##8. How the Game Works (Flow)

* User starts the game by betting the amount 
* The program generates random slot symbols
* Symbols are displayed
* Conditions are checked
* If the user wins then the amount in the account will be equal to the winning conditions else you will be lossing the bet amount.
* THe game continues until the user stops betting the amount.

## 9. Logic Explanation (Core Strength)

* Random values simulate spinning slots
* Conditions compare generated values
* Loop controls continuous gameplay
* Clean separation of logic avoids confusion
